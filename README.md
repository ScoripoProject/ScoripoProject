Lucky draw with Tora
=================
**A system that simulate and predict the result of lucky draw.**

This is a little project that I keep as a record how I learn to use Django for web development. I mainly follow the tutorial of Tango with Django, however, it is not limited to the tutorial and should be more that it.

As I need a good record as a reference on how to develop with Django in the future, I plan each commit carefully.

## Purpose

## Design overview


Getting Started
===============

## Setup

To prevent breaking our system and prevent dependency hell, we are going to setup a development environment in virtual environment.

### The Setup process 1:
Setup a [virtual environment] (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) with [virtualenv] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and [virtualenvwrapper] (https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Firstly, install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.

    pip install virtualenv
    pip install virtualenvwrapper

And then execute a shell script to activate a virtual environment.

	source virtualenvwrapper.sh 

(Try `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` instead if you cannot not activate a virtual environment succussfully. And please refer to the doc of virtualenvwrapper.)

Then create a virtual environment for the project, and then activate it.

	mkvirtualenv rango
	workon rango

(As we are going to execute Django on python 3, we should tell virtualenv where the python3 located by issuing `mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 rango`, which the location of python3 could be found by issuing `whereis python3`)

When a `(rango)$` is shown on prompt, you are successfully in a virtual environment `rango`.

Once a virtual environment is setup, we are focus on Python stuffs now:

Check if you have Django installed with `pip list`:

	pip list

Install Django with `pip`:

	pip install django

This will install the latest stable Django. However, we should install all the required package with `requiruments.txt`.

	pip install -r requirements.txt

It will install the packages automatically with matching version.

### The Setup process 2:
Setup the environment with docker.

Refer to the official doc of docker on Django, we should prepare a `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt` and `docker-compose.yml`:

	workon rango
	pip freeze > requirements.txt

And then create a project and execute the docker environment

	docker-compose run web django-admin.py startproject tango_with_django_project
	docker-compose up

(ref: https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/)

## Run it!

Edit `ALLOWED_HOSTS = []` in setting.py. Activate the virtual environment and then run the test server

	source virtualenvwrapper.sh # if the workon command does not recognized
	workon rango
	python manage.py runserver

## Testing

All .py files start with 'test_' could be automatically run with unittest / pytest.

For running unittest:

	python -m unittest
	
For running pytest:

	python -m pytest

	
## Deployment

Update the requirements.txt with the current packages by

	pip freeze > requirements.txt
